# Number Sorter

## What It Does
- Sorts numbers from highest to lowest
- Takes user input for five numbers
- Uses the bubble sort algorithm
- Shows the top three highest numbers
  
## How To Use
1. Run the program
2. Enter a number when prompted
3. Repeat step 2 four more times
4. The sorted top three numbers display
   
## Example
Enter numbers: 25, 42, 17, 89, 63
Output: 89, 63, 42 (highest three)

### Code Details
- getReady() prompts for a number input
- detailLoop() stores input in an array
- bubbleSort() sorts the array descending
- finish() prints the top three numbers
- main() controls the program flow

## Notes
- Enter valid integers when prompted
- Size is fixed at five numbers
- This is a procedural C++ program
- I learned that Object-oriented design is better for larger programs
