# Your Tasks

In this lab, you declare and initialize constants in a C++ program. The program, which is in a file named `NewAge2.cpp`, calculates your age in the year 2050.

## Instructions

### Task 1

Declare a constant named `YEAR`, and initialize `YEAR` with the value `2050`.

### Task 2

Edit the statement `myNewAge = myCurrentAge + (2050 âˆ’ currentYear)` so it uses the constant named `YEAR`.

### Task 3

Edit the statement `cout << "I will be " << myNewAge << " in 2050." << endl;` so it uses the constant named `YEAR`.

### Task 4

All instances of inline, hard-coded `2050` have been replaced with the `YEAR` constant.
