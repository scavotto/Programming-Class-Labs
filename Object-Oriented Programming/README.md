# C++ Rectangle Program - Object Oriented Programming Practice
This is a simple C++ program that calculates the area and perimeter of a rectangle. The program prompts the user to enter the length and width of the rectangle, and then displays the calculated area and perimeter.

The program consists of three files:

- Rectangle.h - This is the header file that defines the Rectangle class, which has methods to set the length and width, and calculate the area and perimeter.
- Rectangle.cpp - This is the implementation file that defines the methods of the Rectangle class.
- RectangleLab.cpp - This is the main program file that creates a Rectangle object, prompts the user for the length and width, and then calculates and displays the area and perimeter.

To use the program, simply run the RectangleLab.cpp file. The program will prompt the user to enter the length and width of the rectangle, and then display the calculated area and perimeter.
