## Your Tasks
In this lab, you will open a file, flowers.dat, and read input from that file in a pre-written C++ program. The program should read and print the names of flowers and whether they are grown in shade or sun.

### Task 1
Write the C++ statements that will open the input file, flowers.dat, for reading.

### Task 3
Write a while loop to read the input until EOF is reached. In the body of the loop, print the name of each flower and where it can be grown (sun or shade).

An example of the program is shown below:

```cpp

Astilbe is grown in the Shade
Marigold is grown in the Sun
Begonia is grown in the Sun
Primrose is grown in the Shade
Cosmos is grown in the Sun
Dahlia is grown in the Sun
Geranium is grown in the Sun
Foxglove is grown in the Shade
Trillium is grown in the Shade
Pansy is grown in the Sun
Petunia is grown in the Sun
Daisy is grown in the Sun
Aster is grown in the Sun
